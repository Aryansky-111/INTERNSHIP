Report</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This report provides an analysis of the network traffic captured in
the <code>Taskk5.pcap</code> file. The analysis aims to identify the
types of protocols present, common network conversations, and potential
security-related anomalies.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-hierarchy">Protocol Hierarchy</h2>
<p>The following is a summary of the protocol distribution observed in
the PCAP file:</p>
<pre><code>eth                                      frames:1672 bytes:174101
  ip                                     frames:1499 bytes:156483
    udp                                  frames:114 bytes:21237
      mdns                               frames:102 bytes:19089
      ssdp                               frames:12 bytes:2148
    icmp                                 frames:1372 bytes:134456
    igmp                                 frames:7 bytes:378
    tcp                                  frames:6 bytes:412
  ipv6                                   frames:91 bytes:14174
    udp                                  frames:76 bytes:12852
      mdns                               frames:76 bytes:12852
    icmpv6                               frames:15 bytes:1322
  arp                                    frames:82 bytes:3444</code></pre>
<p>From the protocol hierarchy, it is evident that ICMP traffic
constitutes a significant portion of the IPv4 traffic, likely indicating
ping activities. MDNS and SSDP are also present, which are common for
service discovery on local networks. TCP traffic is minimal, suggesting
limited application-layer communication over TCP during the capture
period.</p>

<p>The conversation between <code>172.20.190.6</code> and
<code>8.8.8.8</code> (Google DNS) is the most prominent, accounting for
a large number of ICMP packets, consistent with the protocol hierarchy
analysis. This indicates frequent communication with a public DNS
server, possibly for connectivity checks or DNS resolution. The other
conversations involve multicast addresses, typical for local network
discovery protocols.</p>
<h2 id="tcp-conversation-analysis">TCP Conversation Analysis</h2>
<p>Only a few TCP conversations were identified in the capture. The
following are the details of the observed TCP packets, including
source/destination IPs and ports, and TCP flags (SYN, ACK, FIN,
RST):</p>
<pre><code>172.20.190.6    39766   184.84.232.243  80  1   0   0   0
184.84.232.243  80  172.20.190.6    39766   1   1   0   0
172.20.190.6    39766   184.84.232.243  80  0   1   0   0
172.20.190.6    39766   184.84.232.243  80  0   1   1   0
184.84.232.243  80  172.20.190.6    39766   0   1   1   0
172.20.190.6    39766   184.84.232.243  80  0   1   0   0</code></pre>
<p>The TCP conversation primarily involves <code>172.20.190.6</code>
communicating with <code>184.84.232.243</code> on port 80, which is
typically used for HTTP. The flag sequence (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, FIN,
FIN-ACK) indicates a normal TCP handshake and connection termination.
There are no immediate signs of suspicious TCP activity such as
excessive RST packets or unusual flag combinations that might suggest
port scanning or denial-of-service attempts. However, further
investigation into the content of these HTTP communications would be
necessary for a complete security assessment.</p>
<h2 id="security-findings-and-observations">Security Findings and
Observations</h2>
<p>Based on the analyzed traffic, the following security-related
observations can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High ICMP Traffic:</strong> The prevalence of ICMP traffic,
particularly to <code>8.8.8.8</code>, is not inherently malicious but
could be indicative of network monitoring, connectivity issues, or even
a basic form of reconnaissance if originating from an unexpected source.
In this case, it appears to be normal network behavior.</li>
<li><strong>MDNS and SSDP Traffic:</strong> The presence of MDNS
(Multicast DNS) and SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) traffic is
common in local networks for device and service discovery. While
generally benign, these protocols can sometimes be exploited for
amplification attacks or information gathering in vulnerable
configurations. No immediate vulnerabilities were identified in this
capture.</li>
<li><strong>Limited TCP Activity:</strong> The minimal TCP traffic
suggests that the captured period did not involve extensive web
browsing, file transfers, or other TCP-heavy applications. The observed
TCP connection to port 80 appears to be a standard HTTP session. Without
deeper packet inspection, itâ€™s difficult to ascertain the nature of the
HTTP communication, but the flag sequence is normal.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Alarming Signatures:</strong> There were no
obvious signs of common network attacks such as widespread port scanning
(many SYN packets without corresponding ACKs), brute-force attempts, or
known malware communication patterns based on the high-level analysis of
protocols and conversations. However, this does not rule out more
sophisticated or encrypted threats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The network traffic in <code>Taskk5.pcap</code> primarily consists of
ICMP, MDNS, and SSDP protocols, indicating regular network operations,
including connectivity checks and local service discovery. TCP activity
is limited but shows a normal HTTP session. While no immediate security
threats or anomalies were identified through this high-level analysis, a
more in-depth inspection of application-layer data (if available and
unencrypted) would be necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.
This report provides a foundational understanding of the network
behavior captured in the provided PCAP file.</p>
